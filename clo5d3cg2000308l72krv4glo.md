### **Introduction**

In the world of DevOps, automation is key. DevOps engineers are tasked with streamlining software development and deployment processes, and one of the most fundamental tools at their disposal is the Linux shell. With a basic understanding of Linux shell scripting, DevOps engineers can create custom automation scripts to save time, reduce errors, and enhance efficiency. In this blog, we will delve into the essentials of Linux shell scripting for DevOps professionals.

### **Why Shell Scripting for DevOps?**

Shell scripting is the process of writing a series of commands to be executed by the shell, which can automate tasks, system administration, and other repetitive operations. For DevOps engineers, this is invaluable because it allows them to:

1. **Automation**: Shell scripts enable the automation of various manual tasks, from system configuration to application deployment.
    
2. **Consistency**: Automated scripts ensure that tasks are executed consistently every time, reducing the risk of human error.
    
3. **Efficiency**: Tasks that might take hours when done manually can be completed in seconds through shell scripting.
    
4. **Reproducibility**: Scripts can be reused, shared, and modified, making it easy to reproduce processes across different environments.
    

### **What is Kernel?**

The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computerâ€™s operating system, with complete control over everything in the system.

### **Let's dive into the basics of Linux shell scripting:**

### **Understanding the Shell**

The first step in Linux shell scripting is understanding the shell you're working with. The most commonly used shells are:

1. **Bash**: The Bourne Again Shell is the default on many Linux distributions and is widely used in DevOps.
    
2. **Zsh**: Z Shell is an interactive shell with powerful scripting capabilities.
    
3. **Ksh**: The Korn Shell is an improved version of the original Bourne Shell.
    

### **Automation Writing Your First Script**

### **Writing Your First Script**

To start, you need a text editor. Nano, Vim, or VSCode are popular choices. Open your editor and create a new file with a `.sh` extension (e.g., [`myscript.sh`](http://myscript.sh)).

Here's a basic script to get you started:

* The first line, `#!/bin/bash`, is called a shebang and specifies the interpreter for the script.
    
* `echo` is used to print text to the console.
    

### **Variables**

Shell scripts often involve variables to store data. Here's an example script to take user input, input from arguments and print the variables:

This script will read the input from user and save it to variable called name. In second line its printing the output.

### **Control Structures**

To make your scripts more powerful, you can use conditional statements and loops. Example of If else in Shell Scripting by comparing 2 numbers.
